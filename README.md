# Dashboard

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.4. This is inspired by `https://dashboardpack.com/live-demo-preview/?livedemo=1881`, with some modifications based on personal preference. The goal is to duplicate and modify certain parts. Note that not everything was intentionally copied—some styling elements were too challenging given my current skill level. However, I’m continuously learning and will revisit those parts once I’ve improved.

##Technology use
Angular 19
Bootstrap 5 and icons




## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
